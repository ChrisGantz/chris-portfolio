          Hello! My name is Christopher or chris for short. I am full stack
          developer. Although I dont know much about these techs yet!, I am 
          fascinated about machine learining, augmented and virtual
          reality. They will definitely change the future.
          More about me! I am 21 years old and have not neccessarily always been
          around computers but I was around machines, cars, and a lot of math. I
          love strategy and puzzle type games, chess being one of my favorite pass times. I
          am a full stack developer although I would prefer to specialize creating
          the back-end. My ultimate goal is to work with artificial intelligence,
          machine learning, neuronetworks, and augmented reality for me that is
          the goal! and the future.{" "}
