        <p>
          Hello! My name is Christopher or chris for short. I am full stack
          developer. I am crazy about machine learining, augmented and virtual
          reality. My family is very academically math orientated, so I do love
          problem solving :D. My dad had worked as a systems engineer at his job,
          and my brother works as mechanical engineer.
      </p>{" "}
        <p>
          I thought I would follow my brother and be a mechanical engineer but
          found I didnt really enjoy it, so I tried electrical engineering and it
          was interesting but I also didnt really enjoy it, while going for my
          bachelor's in electrical engineering I had taken C++, and Java classes
          and I found that I really enjoyed it and knew I could make a career of
          it. That is when I found a great bootcamp called Thinkful! There I was
          prepared for the neccessary skills to be a full stack dev.
      </p>
        <p>
          More about me! I am 21 years old and have not neccessarily always been
          around computers but I was around machines, cars, and a lot of math. I
          love strategy and puzzle type games, chess being one of my favorite. I
          am a full stack developer although I would prefer to specialize creating
          the back-end. My ultimate goal is to work with artificial intelligence,
          machine learning, neuronetworks, and augmented reality for me that is
        the goal! and I believe is the future.{" "}
