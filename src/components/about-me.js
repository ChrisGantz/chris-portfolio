        Hello! My name is Chris. I am full stack developer. I am crazy about
        machine learining, augmented and virtual reality. My family is very
        academically math orientated, so I did reach high level math courses. My
        dad had worked as a systems engineer at his job, and my brother works as
        mechanical engineer. I thought I would follow my brother and be a
        mechanical engineer but found I didnt really enjoy it, so I tried
        electrical engineering and it was interesting but I also didnt really
        enjoy it, but while going for my bachelor's in electrical engineering I
        had taken some programming classes and found that I really love it I
        could do this as a carreer I enjoy it. That is when I found a great
        bootcamp called Thinkful!
