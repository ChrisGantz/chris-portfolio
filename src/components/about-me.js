          Hello! My name is Christopher, or “Chris” for short. I am a full stack developer passionate about programming to me it is like writing music when everything begins to piece together its amazing. Although I don’t know much about these techs yet! I am fascinated by machine learning as well as augmented and virtual reality. They will definitely change the future.

          I enjoy working on a team. I have had great experiences in the past as well as hardships and how to deal with them, but I am definitely a team player. I graduated from a boot camp called Thinkful, where they showed us how to pair program. Our last project was in fact a group project and I enjoyed the ability to bounce ideas of each other. There may be things you don’t know that someone else does. I think having a team really makes the experience greater!

          More about me! I am 21 years old and have not necessarily always been around computers, but I was around machines, cars, and a lot of math. I love strategy and puzzle type games; chess being one of my favorite pass times. I am a Full Stack Developer though I would prefer to specialize in creating the Backend. My ultimate goal is to work with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Neuro-networks, and Augmented Reality. That is the goal and the future!{" "}
